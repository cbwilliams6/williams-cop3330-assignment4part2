# Help for To-Do List Application
When you load the program, the list view is automatically shown. 
Every function of the to-do list program can be found in this singular view.

## Adding Items
Adding items to the table is simple. Just enter a description into the textbox,
then pick out a date by clicking the calendar button, and finally use the
choice box to set if the item is completed or incomplete. After that, just
click "Add Item".

Don't worry about misclicking to add an item that doesn't have every field yet.
The program won't add items to the table unless they have all 3 fields filled out.

## Editing Items
To edit an item, first click on it in the table. This will put all its info
into the fields directly under the table. Simply make whatever changes you 
want using those fields, then click the "Edit Item" button.

To deselect an item, just double click anywhere. This will remove all its info
from the fields below the table, but the item itself will still be the same.

## Removing Item(s)
Removing items is fairly similar to editing them.

*To remove a single item:*
Click on the item you want to remove in the table list, then just click
on the "Remove Item" button.

*To remove all items:*
To remove every item from the entire to-do list, just click on the "Remove All"
button. Be careful, as this cannot be undone unless you saved the list somewhere
else.

## Filtering Items
On the top right corner of the application, there are various options to
filter what items should be shown in the table.

"All" will show every item in the to-do list, without filtering

"Complete" will only show items that are marked as completed

"Incomplete" will only show items that are marked as incomplete

## Saving and Loading Lists
On the bottom right corner, there is a button called "Save" and one called
"Load".

When clicking on "Save", an explorer window will pop up, allowing you to
select where to save the list. Selecting a location will automatically
save a copy of the list there.

Clicking "Load" will also bring up an explorer. However this time, you must
navigate to whatever list you want to load into the application. The list must
be named "List.txt" in order to load properly.
